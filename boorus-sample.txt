#any non-stock boorus go here, i make no guarentee if they'll work or not
#broken site reports would be appreciated, but are more likely an issue with pybooru than with this program

#line format: site	api_version
#api version is optional
#empty lines and lines beginning with # are ignored
#as of right now, custom sites can only be moebooru-based sites, support for plain danbooru ones should be coming sometime eventually

#some examples:

#sites can be full urls, or just the domain
#site.com
#http://site.com
#https://site.com

#valid versions are shown here, shouldnt be needed unless a site doesnt work right
#site.com	1.13.0
#site.com	1.13.0+update.1
#site.com	1.13.0+update.2
